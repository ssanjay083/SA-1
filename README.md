# AIM

To build expertise in utilizing NumPy and Pandas for effective data handling and analysis, including managing incomplete datasets, applying mathematical and summary functions, and operating on structures like arrays, Series, and tabular data formats.

# REQUIRED LIBRARIES

The exercise begins by importing the necessary libraries: NumPy for array manipulations and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

# ALGORITHM

**1.Import Libraries**

Import NumPy as np and Pandas as pd.

**2.Create Data Structures**

Initialize NumPy arrays, Pandas Series, and DataFrames with sample data.

**3.Handle Missing Values**

Introduce and process missing data using functions like isnull(), fillna(), or dropna().

**4.Perform Mathematical Operations**

Apply NumPy and Pandas functions to perform element-wise arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, mean, std, etc.).

**5.Execute Aggregation Functions**

Use aggregation methods like sum(), mean(), min(), and max() on arrays, Series, and DataFrames.

**6.Access and Modify Data**

Access specific elements using indexing, slicing, or label-based selection (iloc, loc) and modify values.

**7.Display Results**

Print or display results at each step for verification and clarity.

# RESULT
The program was executed successfully, demonstrating effective use of NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. Missing values were systematically identified and addressed through mean imputation. Core data operations such as arithmetic computations, aggregation, indexing, and conditional filtering were performed efficiently. The implementation showcased proficiency in handling both structured arrays and tabular data, providing a solid foundation for further analytical and machine learning tasks.
